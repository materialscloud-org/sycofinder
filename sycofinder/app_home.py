SyCoFinder was designed to aid humans and robots to efficiently explore the space
of experimental parameters in chemical synthesis.

The first component generates a diverse set of synthesis conditions
in the chemical space defined by the user (potentially already including chemical
intuition by assigning variable importance).

Users then perform experiments and record the fitness of the samples obtained
(fitness scores can be application-specific, higher is better). These records are fed
into the second component of the app, which optimizes the synthesis conditions
using a genetic algorithm.
This step can be repeated until a satisfactory result is obtained.

Finally, the complete set of experiments and fitness records can be used to determine
the importance of experimental variables using a machine learning algorithm.

SyCoFinder was designed with the synthesis of metal-organic frameworks in mind
but may be useful in other applications of robotic synthesis.
